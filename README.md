# SuperMarioDash

Endless runner game based on Canabalt and with Super Mario World theme.

Done in C++ and Allegro.

This project was made for a selective process to the Game Dev Project (GDP, www.gamedevproject.com.br).

All the images and sounds were found on the internet.
I don't pretend to make any money from this game. It was made for study purposes only.
This project was made in 2012 and i don't remember from where i got the assets to give the credits. I apologise.
